        There are two gymnastics teams, Dolphins and Koalas. They compete
        against each other 3 times. The winner with the highest average score
        wins a trophy!
      </p>
      <p>Your tasks:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below
        </li>
        <li>
          Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the
          competition, and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can
          be a draw, so test for that as well (draw means they have the same
          average score)
        </li>
        <li>
          Bonus 1: Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. With this
          rule, a team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team,
          and the same time a score of at least 100 points. Hint: Use a logical
          operator to test for minimum score, as well as multiple else-if blocks
        </li>
        <li>
          Bonus 2: Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens
          when both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or
          equal 100 points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Test data:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Data 1: Dolphins score 96, 108 and 89. Koalas score 88, 91 and 110
        </li>
        <li>
          Data Bonus 1: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and
          123
        </li>
        <li>
          Data Bonus 2: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and
          106
        </li>
      </ol>
