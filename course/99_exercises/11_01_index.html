        Julia and Kate are doing a study on dogs. So each of them asked 5 dog
        owners about their dog's age, and stored the data into an array (one
        array for each). For now, they are just interested in knowing whether a
        dog is an adult or a puppy. A dog is an adult if it is at least 3 years
        old, and it's a puppy if it's less than 3 years old.
      </p>
      <p>Your tasks:</p>
      <p>
        Create a function 'checkDogs', which accepts 2 arrays of dog's ages
        ('dogsJulia' and 'dogsKate'), and does the following things:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Julia found out that the owners of the first and the last two dogs
          actually have cats, not dogs! So create a shallow copy of Julia's
          array, and remove the cat ages from that copied array (because it's a
          bad practice to mutate function parameters)
        </li>
        <li>Create an array with both Julia's (corrected) and Kate's data</li>
        <li>
          For each remaining dog, log to the console whether it's an adult ("Dog
          number 1 is an adult, and is 5 years old") or a puppy ("Dog number 2
          is still a puppy üê∂")
        </li>
        <li>Run the function for both test datasets</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Test data:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Data 1: Julia's data [3, 5, 2, 12, 7], Kate's data [4, 1, 15, 8, 3]
        </li>
        <li>
          Data 2: Julia's data [9, 16, 6, 8, 3], Kate's data [10, 5, 6, 1, 4]
        </li>

        Let's go back to Julia and Kate's study about dogs. This time, they want
        to convert dog ages to human ages and calculate the average age of the
        dogs in their study.
      </p>
      <p>Your tasks:</p>
      <p>
        Create a function 'calcAverageHumanAge', which accepts an arrays of
        dog's ages ('ages'), and does the following things in order:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Calculate the dog age in human years using the following formula: if
          the dog is <= 2 years old, humanAge = 2 * dogAge. If the dog is > 2
          years old, humanAge = 16 + dogAge * 4
        </li>
        <li>
          Exclude all dogs that are less than 18 human years old (which is the
          same as keeping dogs that are at least 18 years old)
        </li>
        <li>
          Calculate the average human age of all adult dogs (you should already
          know from other challenges how we calculate averages üòâ)
        </li>
        <li>Run the function for both test datasets</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Test data:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Data 1: [5, 2, 4, 1, 15, 8, 3]</li>
        <li>Data 2: [16, 6, 10, 5, 6, 1, 4]</li>
      </ul>
