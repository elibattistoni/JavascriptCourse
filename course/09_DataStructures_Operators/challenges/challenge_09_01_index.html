      <p>
        We're building a football betting app (soccer for my American friends
        ðŸ˜…)! Suppose we get data from a web service about a certain game ('game'
        variable on next page). In this challenge we're gonna work with that
        data.
      </p>
      <p>Your tasks:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Create one player array for each team (variables 'players1' and
          'players2')
        </li>
        <li>
          The first player in any player array is the goalkeeper and the others
          are field players. For Bayern Munich (team 1) create one variable
          ('gk') with the goalkeeper's name, and one array ('fieldPlayers') with
          all the remaining 10 field players
        </li>
        <li>
          Create an array 'allPlayers' containing all players of both teams (22
          players)
        </li>
        <li>
          During the game, Bayern Munich (team 1) used 3 substitute players. So
          create a new array ('players1Final') containing all the original team1
          players plus 'Thiago', 'Coutinho' and 'Perisic'
        </li>
        <li>
          Based on the game.odds object, create one variable for each odd
          (called 'team1', 'draw' and 'team2')
        </li>
        <li>
          Write a function ('printGoals') that receives an arbitrary number of
          player names (not an array) and prints each of them to the console,
          along with the number of goals that were scored in total (number of
          player names passed in)
        </li>
        <li>
          The team with the lower odd is more likely to win. Print to the
          console which team is more likely to win, without using an if/else
          statement or the ternary operator.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Test data for 6.: First, use players 'Davies', 'Muller', 'Lewandowski'
        and 'Kimmich'. Then, call the function again with players from
        game.scored
      </p>

    <div class="instructions">
      <p>
        Let's continue with our football betting app! Keep using the 'game'
        variable from before.
      </p>
      <p>Your tasks:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Loop over the game.scored array and print each player name to the
          console, along with the goal number (Example: "Goal 1: Lewandowski")
        </li>
        <li>
          Use a loop to calculate the average odd and log it to the console (We
          already studied how to calculate averages, you can go check if you
          don't remember)
        </li>
        <li>
          Print the 3 odds to the console, but in a nice formatted way, exactly
          like this:
          <ul>
            <li>Odd of victory Bayern Munich: 1.33</li>
            <li>Odd of draw: 3.25</li>
            <li>Odd of victory Borrussia Dortmund: 6.5</li>
          </ul>
          Get the team names directly from the game object, don't hardcode them
          (except for "draw"). Hint: Note how the odds and the game objects have
          the same property names
        </li>
        <li>
          Bonus: Create an object called 'scorers' which contains the names of
          the players who scored as properties, and the number of goals as the
          value. In this game, it will look like this:
        </li>
      </ol>
      <pre><code>
        { 
          Gnarby: 1,
          Hummels: 1,
          Lewandowski: 2 
        }
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <h1>Coding Challenge #3 (09_DataStructures_Operators)</h1>
    <div class="instructions">
      <p>
        Let's continue with our football betting app! This time, we have a map
        called 'gameEvents' (see below) with a log of the events that happened
        during the game. The values are the events themselves, and the keys are
        the minutes in which each event happened (a football game has 90 minutes
        plus some extra time).
      </p>
      <p>Your tasks:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Create an array 'events' of the different game events that happened
          (no duplicates)
        </li>
        <li>
          After the game has finished, is was found that the yellow card from
          minute 64 was unfair. So remove this event from the game events log.
        </li>
        <li>
          Compute and log the following string to the console: "An event
          happened, on average, every 9 minutes" (keep in mind that a game has
          90 minutes)
        </li>
        <li>
          Loop over 'gameEvents' and log each element to the console, marking
          whether it's in the first half or second half (after 45 min) of the
          game, like this:
          <br />
          âš½ [FIRST HALF] 17: GOAL
        </li>
      </ol>
