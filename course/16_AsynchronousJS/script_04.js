//# HANDLING REJECTED PROMISES with .catch() and .finally()
//==============================================================================
// so far we have assumed that everything went well with our AJAX calls, we never handled errors
// best practice is to handle errors because it is very common
// remember that a promise in which an error happens, is a REJECTED PROMISE; therefore we are going to learn how to handle PROMISE REJECTIONS

// NB the only way in which the fetch promise rejects, is when the user loses his internet connection
// NB in order to simulate losing the internet connection, we can go in the tab Network in the browser inspect, and change the speed to offline
// however, when we reload the page, everything disappears, but it is not what we want
// NB we want to simulate that the page was first still loaded but then, as the user does the request without internet, we want to see an error

const renderError = function (msg) {
  countriesContainer.insertAdjacentText("beforeend", msg);
  countriesContainer.style.opacity = 1;

    .then(
      (response) => response.json()
      // (err) => alert(err) //# OPTION 1 (handle error in each function)
    )
    .then((data) => {
      renderCountryData(data[0]);

      // Country 2
      const neighbour = data[0].borders?.[0] || null;
      if (!neighbour) return;
      const neighbourUrl = `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/alpha/${neighbour}`;
      return fetch(neighbourUrl);
    })
    .then(
      (response) => response.json()
      // (err) => alert(err) //# OPTION 1 (handle error in each function)
    )
    .then((data) => renderCountryData(data[0], "neighbour"))
    .catch((err) => {
      // NB with .catch() errors propagate down the chain until they get caught
      console.error(`${err} üí• üí• üí•`); //# OPTION 2 (better) handle all the errors globally in just one place (it handles all the errors, no matter where they appear in the chain)
      // we also want to display a message for the user to see
      renderError(`Something went wrong üí• üí• üí• ${err.message}. Try again!`);
      // NB err is a JavaScript object (we can create errors in JS with a constructor, like we create e.g. maps or sets)
      // NB any error created like this contains the messag property, so we can use that property to print the message and not the whole object
      // NB the err object contains also the stack trace
    })
    .finally(() => {
      // NB this callback function will be called whatever happens with the promise: it iwll be called no matter if the promise was fulfilled or rejected
    });
};

// we want to call the function whenever the user clicks on a button
btn.addEventListener("click", function () {
  getCountryNeighbour("portugal");
  // getCountryNeighbour("germany");
});

// if you set Offline, and click the button again, you will get the error of "Uncaught promise" because we have failed to fetch

/// there are 2 ways of handling rejections
/// 1. pass a second callback function into the then method (the first callback will be called for the fulfilled promise, the second promise for the rejected promise)
/// 2. handle all the errors globally with the .catch() method

// NOTE: .then() is called if the promise is fulfilled; .catch() is called if the promise is rejected; .finally() is called always (regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected)

// TODO continue with lecture 254 at 7:44
